# AJN-FinalProject
CS Final Project by Atul Venkatesan, JD Elia, and Nolan Nguyen

To run this program, make sure your terminal is in the same folder as the "maingame.py" file is in, and type in the command, "python3 maingame.py". 

To start the game itself, all you have to do is click anywhere on the screen.

You control a red bean character starting on the left of the screen, and your task is to get to the other side and dash past the right-hand screen boundary. Doing this will make your character reappear on the left side of the screen, and earn you a point. Be careful to avoid the enemy running in the opposite direction as you do so, because colliding with it will cause you to lose automatically!

Your character is equipped with two abilities. The first is a jump, using the "W" key. The next ability is a dash, which you can use to go either left or right using the "A" and "D" keys, respectively. Use them wisely, though - there is a set cooldown period of a couple seconds where you cannot use it. 

When you lose, you will receive your final score. Our restart button is not working, so when you click anywhere on the screen instead you will be exited out of the window.
